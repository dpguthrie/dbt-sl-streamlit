# dbt Cloud Semantic Layer on Streamlit

Use this streamlit app to view the metrics you've defined in your project.  The only thing you'll need to define is the `JDBC_URL` that you obtain from dbt Cloud.

# Developing

1. Clone the repo
2. Create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
3. Install dependencies

- via `uv` (recommended)
```bash
pip install uv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- via `pip`
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Populate environment variables
- copy the `secrets.toml.example` file in the `.streamlit` folder as `secrets.toml`.
- populate your OpenAI API key
- (Optional) Update the JDBC URL for your instance. Note, this is only necessary for the Embedded page. Since this page has hard coded logics, it's likely you won't need to use this field.

Finally, run your app:

```bash
streamlit run üè†_Home.py
```
